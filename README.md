# Cracking the Coding Interview

This repository contains solutions to everyone's *favorite* interview prep book. I always work out these problems on the whiteboard and talk myself through them before coding them up.

These solutions are either my own correct solutions, or solutions taken from the book if the solution I come up with is completely off base. I use these as a helpful review for identifying typical patterns in coding problems.
